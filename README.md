# Insta News

## Project Brief
 Insta News is an interactive platform where users can view filtered NY Times news articles. The design vision was to allow users to browse news images with brief snippits of article text, and further access full articles upon selecting the news image. This project was coded for mobile first, with CSS grid, Sass mix-ins and Flexbox being used to create a responsive design.

### Personal Learnings 

This time around what I enjoyed most, though it was difficult, was learning how to use jQuery, ajax and mix-ins in this project. After learning these, I can now see the value of coding smart and effieceint. Compared to the previous Aloha project, the way I coded Insta News was much more consise, as I was able to cut out many repetitive elements in my process. My biggest takeaway was CSS grid, as it was so easy to quickly set up a layout for my image boxes. Compared to FlexBox, I found Grid to be much more straight-foward. I'm looking forward to practicing grid more, to be able to use it to it's full potential in future projects.
